As a consultant for the startup i would recommend my client to develop whichever platform they are comfortable developing the app for because as for the
business goals of the company i.e(manufacturing custom designed/printed T-Shirt) can both be reached via both platform.


And as for my personal opinion, 
	I would recommend my client to develop a mobile app for their company. As most of the user base for the company they are starting are going to be
ranging from teenagers to adults, and both of those user base have mobile and use it frequently. Rather than browsing websites, most of them feel comfortable 
using an application that is easier to access at anytime.


 But i would recommend following things
to the startup: 

1. To do proper anlaysis and research on what the audience/user for their website is going to be on the basis of age/location/sex or any kind of social, economical
and environmental aspects.

2. What do most of those audience use to browse internet and spend most of their time with.

3. Does the platform they choose is going to help them achieve their business goals to a certain extent.

4. Is the platform they choose is going to give them proper exposure as they want to their estimated audiences.


	Doing proper anlaysis is a key part for the planning of any software development. As a consultant i would recommend them to do proper analysis on their 
business goals and what platform is better for their estimated clients. I would also recommend my client to make the software more user friendly and simple as
possible for the users to access.

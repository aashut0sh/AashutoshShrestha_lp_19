1. I would test whether the user is able to not login with invalid username or password along with,
	testing whether the user is able to login with valid username or password.

2. I would test Form validation whether any required filled in order to login is empty, such as if username
	or password field is empty and whether username field contain any special characters that are invalid.
3. I would examine whether the form validates if the reuqired character lenght for the password or username exceeds or does not reach.

4. I would test whether the password entered trims the left/right.

5. I would test how the username field treats the UPPER CASE and lower case.

6. I would examine if the password entered is encrypted while typing or not.

7. I would examine whether the password can be copied/cut and pasted anywhere else.

8. I would test whether the Other Authentications Option redirects to another page.

9. I would examine incase of an invalid login, whether the form displays message of the field that is incorrect,
	i.e whether "password is incorrect" or the "username is incorrect", rather than "username or password is incorrect"
	because it may help attackers to bruteforce the field which if specified for invalid login.

10. I would test whether the forgot password option redirects user to be able to reset the password.

11. I would test whether there is a limit to the unsuccesfull login attempts.

12. I would test whether SQL injection attack or XXS vulnerability works.

13. I would test whether the login page is redirected if the url is bypassed.
